# A/B Testing

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`ab.ipynb`) that performs an analysis of A/B test results. This dataset emulates information regarding visits made by users on imaginary retail websites across the UK. So, in this scenario, let the color 'White' be assigned to Group A which is the default setting for the background color on the website, representing the control group. Also, let the color 'Black' be equivalent to Group B which is the newer setting to test. The notebook includes the following sections:

## 1. Introduction
- Overview of the A/B test and its objectives.

## 2. Data Loading and Cleaning
- Loading the dataset.
- Cleaning the data by handling missing values and duplicates.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics of the dataset.
- Visualizations to understand the distribution of key variables.

## 4. Hypothesis Testing
- Formulating the null and alternative hypotheses.
- Performing statistical tests to determine the significance of the results.

## 5. Results Interpretation
- Interpreting the results of the hypothesis tests.
- Drawing conclusions based on the analysis.

## 6. Conclusion
- Summary of findings.
- Recommendations based on the analysis.

## How to Run the Notebook
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
4. Run the cells in the notebook to reproduce the analysis.
